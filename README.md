Hi reviewer,

I created entities according to assignment, I'm very curious if my relational mapping done properly.
I added also three repositories for each entity. Further I started with creating controllers (and
dto), but haven't finished it yet. In start class I added commandlinerunner so that I was able to tetst my repositories a bit and see the results in logs.

Cheers,
Yulia
